  "What is CRAQ's write-all-read-any approach?": "CRAQ sends write requests to the head target and propagates them along a chain, while read requests can be sent to any target3.",
  "How does 3FS distribute read traffic for better load balance?": "Read traffic is evenly distributed among all targets in a chain3.",
  "What is the purpose of the chain table in 3FS?": "The chain table defines the replication chains for storing file chunks3.",
  "How are storage targets created in 3FS?": "Multiple storage targets are created on each SSD, and they join different chains3.",
  "What happens when a storage target is offline?": "The chain table is updated by incrementing the version number when a storage target is offline3.",
  "Who makes changes to the chain tables?": "Only the primary cluster manager makes changes to chain tables3.",
  "How does 3FS handle file deletion when files are open?": "3FS delays deletion until all file descriptors are closed for files opened in write mode3.",
  "What is the purpose of file sessions in 3FS?": "File sessions track file descriptors opened in write mode to prevent unreclaimable garbage chunks3.",
  "How does 3FS handle concurrent writes to the same file?": "3FS ensures eventual consistency for file lengths by periodically updating the maximum write position3.",
  "What is the rendezvous hash algorithm used for in 3FS?": "The rendezvous hash algorithm is used to distribute file length update tasks across multiple meta services3.",
